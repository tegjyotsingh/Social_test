Q) Extract all your friend's Bdays and store it in a file. If the friend doesnt have a public bday specified, enter it as NA-fb. Store the name, fblink, Bday in JSON files. 
----------------------------------
Problem: 
starting from V2, fb does not allow us to get friends unless they are in the app themselves

Starting with Linkedin API
---------------------------
Q) Can you extract your connections list?
A) Yes but only the r_basicprofile
